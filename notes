interesting hist: change

"time_in_hospital" box plot: nearly exactly the same; jitter: nothing interesting
"num_lab_procedures" box plot: nearly the same with similar mean;
"num_procedures" box plot: nearly exactly the same
"num_medications"  box plot: nearly the same with similar mean; jitter: non admitted heavier tail, admitted more positively skewed
"number_outpatient"  box plot: nearly the same with mostly 0, False has slightly more outpatients; jitter non-re heavier tail
"number_inpatient" box plot: same mean 0, readmitted patients have heavy tail
"number_emergency" box plot: same mean 0, non-re patients have slightly heavier tail; jitter agree
"number_diagnoses" box plot: same range, readmitted patients have higher mean; jitter: and heavier tail
